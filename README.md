## VUW Interaction Design 112 Project 3 Version Control

*Craig Springett*


This project combines the interactions of Projects 1 and 2, with regards and relation to Twitch TV and their emotes.

Project 1 required us to analyse an interaction from three different perspectives, whilst Project 2 required us to abstract some form of kinetic movement from this first interaction. For Project 1, I looked at Twitch TV and how communication between the live chat and the live streamer can be expressed through emotes, and their different interpretations. This lead me to abstract the idea of bringing together two or more ideas and creating something new, resulting in my Project 2 kinetic movement of turning a cog, bringing together two plates that would complete a circuit, lighting a bulb. For this project, the plan is to keep this idea of turning a cog, but provide an interactive and educational website that teaches visitors about various different Twitch Emotes and what their common meaning is in context of the live Twitch chat. This will be achieved by having two wheels on either side of the page with one side having images, and the other having their descriptions, and it's up to the user to try and match the correct pairs.
